<DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><H1>Dictionary</H1></DIV>

All abbreviations like `sw => software`, `tv => television`, `0 => nothing` etc. `crab` takes from `dict.txt`. 

‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution:** If you will remove `dict.txt`, then `crab` won't run (however, you can bypass it by `-D` flag).

## Adding or removing words
### Adding
If you want to add word, then append abbreviation like `abbr - abbreviation` into end of file.

‚úîÔ∏è Examples:

* `mem - memory`
* `gpu - videocard`
* `ver - version`
* `kb - keyboard`
* `snd - sound`

‚ùé Please, do **NOT** write like:
* `V - volume, version`
* `X - extended, execute`

### Removing
Just remove disliked abbreviation! It is simple, isn't it?

### Behavior when `dict.txt` has values-duplicates (e.g. `V - volume, vol - volume`)
The first key `(V)` will have mory priority than the second.
